          <p id="Te1">Nowadays, the rural world plays an essential role on the planet and in our lives, being one of the main economic factors, the countryside produces tons of food and materials internationally and boosts various sectors such as transport, production, import and export.</p>
          <p id="Te1">All of this in a certain way is also related to the urban area, which in turn is where the majority of agricultural production is destined. Cities also help the rural sector with industries and technological tools for farmers and large landowners.</p>
          <p id="Te1">The city contributes with its infrastructure, economy and technology, while the countryside contributes with its production, food and sustainability.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <p id="Te1">These factors generate an immense number of opportunities for entrepreneurs and young people, not only due to the great demand that exists for plantations and agricultural activities, but also due to the great technological innovation that has been emerging to operate in these environments, and for this we also need to innovate. These "Opportunities" will bring great benefits to people, but what are they?</p>
          <ul class="benefits-list">
            <li class="Topicos"><strong>Economic development:</strong> In a larger scenario, we can have a perspective that these relationships generate a great benefit for the national and international economy.</li>
            <li class="Topicos"><strong>Export market:</strong> With the agricultural and import/export market in a beneficial set, individuals can support each other to bring cargo and shipments to each other, and thus drive an innovative hub in agribusiness.</li>
            <li class="Topicos"><strong>Cheap and varied foods:</strong> With the other contributing factors, food markets and distributors will have more varied and cheaper products, which in a way helps to combat hunger.</li>
            <li class="Topicos"><strong>Rural professions:</strong> With new technologies and innovations centered between the countryside and the city, new demands for professions begin to emerge and employ new people.</li>
            <li class="Topicos"><strong>Sustainable alternatives:</strong> In the midst of these conclusions, there is also a possibility of bringing sustainability to cities and even the countryside itself, with the reduction of pesticides and other pollutants, and the use of technologies to bring automation in production and in other environments in order to bring more clean environments.</li>
          </ul>
          <p id="Te1">Countless other opportunities also exist and can be explored in all of these areas!</p>

        <div class="text-content">
          <p id="Te1">Nowadays, an immense evolution in various aspects of agricultural production is noticeable, such as the introduction of drones, automations and digital tools present in cities. However, there is a great lack of specialized work in the agro sector. Reflecting that there is little interest within an exceptional demand, the main relevance of this factor is the provision of opportunities and qualifications centered in the urban world.</p>
          <p id="Te1">The great focus of experience is on young people, as they have greater ease with emerging technologies, are in great demand for the application of these new developments in agriculture. Now, the main objective of these farmers and agribusiness managers is to attract this attention to increase the number of young people working in the field.</p>
          <p id="Te1">To attract young people and their innovations to rural areas, entrepreneurs and landowners must invest in startups and digital media to demonstrate to people that the countryside also employs and invests in technology, thus generating specialized and qualified workers, opening up new opportunities.</p>

          <p id="Te1">In general, innovations and developments have a very impact on the lives of the population</p>
